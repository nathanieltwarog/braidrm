\item{concA}{The concentration of drug A}

\description{
A synthetically generated response surface using a flipped "coactive"
parameter vector. The surface was generated with IDMA of 0.5, IDMB of 0.5, na
of 3, nb of 3, kappa of 0, E0 of 0, EfA of 0, EfB of 0, and Ef of 1;
the surface was flipped along both drug axes (so \code{flip} was set to "both").
Every pair of concentrations is sampled once, with concentrations of 0 and a
seven-point two-fold dilution from 0.125 to 8. "Measurements" were sampled
from a normal noise distribution around ground truth values with a standard
deviation of 0.07.
